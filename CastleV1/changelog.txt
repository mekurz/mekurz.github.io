Version 80 - 14-Apr-2013
- General
  - Prevented movement keys from triggering browser window scroll events.
- Status Effects
  - Added PassiveStatChangeStatusEffect with several new spells to demonstrate primary and secondary stat changes.
  - Completed method for applying stat changes to Actors
  
Version 81 - 15-Apr-2013
- General
  - Added a horizontal progress bar for Player XP on the Character Information popup
  - If any damage is received during a long action, the action is immediately interrupted (i.e. no sleeping while affected by poison)
- Status Effects
  - Status effects will now continue to run while long actions are attempted.
  - Status effects on monsters will be removed when the monster is dead.

Version 82 - 24-Apr-2013
- General
  - Upgraded to jQuery 2.0.0 (Canvas isn't supported by old versions of IE anyways!)

Version 83 - 25-Dec-2013
- General
  - Converted to a Visual Studio 2013 project
  - Rearranged some of the TPOC folder structure to clean things up
  - Fixed Kill All Monsters and Test Status Effect debug tests which broke sometime after v78
  - Upgraded to jQuery 2.0.3

Version 84 - 29-Dec-2013
- General
  - Added ImageCombiner to produce a single image out of any number of smaller images.
  - Converted everything except for Spell Images to use a single image rather than multiple individual images.
    - This reduced the number of HTTP requests for images from 80 to 26 during startup.
    - Updated the appropriate locations to draw a small portion of an image rather than the whole thing.
- Inventory
  - Fixed an issue with headgear items not being able to be equipped.
  - Switched item boxes to use canvas instead of img.

Version 85 - 30-Dec-2013
- General
  - Changed combined image columns from 10 to 12 since it works better for math.
- Spells
  - Updated spells to use the new combined image method added for everything else in v84.
    - This further reduced image load requests from 26 down to 6. New method of loading images seems to have improved page load time by over full second.
  - Switched spell toolbar to use canvas instead of img.

Version 86 - 18-Apr-2014
- General
  - Upgraded to jQuery 2.1.0, jQueryUI 1.10.4, Chosen 1.1.0 and QUnit 1.14.0
  - Upgraded to Bootstrap 3.1.1 and consequently had to rearrange a lot of popup work. Much more CSS work is still required.
  - Updated ImageCombiner to prevent a GET operation when loading the XML file for game data. Apparently Image triggers some kind of extra processing in jQuery or the browser.

Version 87 - 19-Jun-2014
- Status Effects
  - Fixed layout due to changes in Bootstrap 3.1.1

Version 88 - 03-May-2016
- General
  - Updated publishing script for Windows 10 environment
  - Updated Prod index.html layout due to Bootstrap 3.1.1 changes
- Widgets
  - Fixed a constructor conflict between Traps and Widget
  - Added animated widgets. Image will cycle to the next frame in the list on each turn. Long-term, this will be a constant animation.

Version 89 - 04-May-2016
- General
  - Switched to CDN for Bootstrap CSS to avoid permissions problem with Win10 font files
- Widgets
  - Animated widgets will start on a random frame (added 2 more firepit frames for variety)
  - Added support for widgets that cannot be walked through
  - Added a lot more widgets
- Map Generator
  - Added random widgets to rooms.

Version 90 - 06-May-2016
- General
  - Upgraded to Bootstrap 3.3.6 and switched to full Bootstrap CDN usage
  - Fixed some CSS related to Bootstrap update
  - FIXED: Creating a new game closes the dialog randomly when clicking the +/- buttons for stats. Seems like upgrading Boostrap fixed the issue, as well as removing the holdit() method.
  - Redesigned character stats to be more like a d20 system.
  - FIXED: Clicking a toggle button (i.e. a spell) then clicking Inventory will leave the button in a toggled state permanently. Current action is now cancelled in open_dialog().
  - FIXED: Dimension door can sometimes pick a spot that is not on the map. Location inbounds check was using maximum map dimensions instead of actual map dimensions.
  - FIXED: Status effects not extending existing effect of the same type (you can get more than one poison from the same ooze). Test code from Version 87 was not undone.
  - CLOSED: Grammar for cone spells is wrong when monster is the source (monster on monster kill). Doesn't appear to be an issue?
  - FIXED: Maximizing the window makes the page layout weird

Version 91 - 16-May-2016
- General
  - Added static animations for widgets! Speed can be controlled via XML settings.

TODO
============
- FEATURE: Need to redesign New Game popup. Something about buttons makes it act weird and keep refreshing the page (Bootstrap class stuff??)
- BUG: Some wall tiles get marked as "too dark to see" based on what's on one side vs the other... need some kind of directional tooltip?
- BUG: Appears to be some problems with tooltips deciding if it's too dark or not for Widgets
- BUG: Monsters can spawn ontop of the Player
- BUG: Monsters going through doors that have been explored but are not within sight appear to magically open... need a way to hide this
- BUG: Right-clicking then dragging onto the tooltip and releasing displays the browser's right-click menu and leaves the tooltip displayed
       Tooltip should move with mouse cursor
- BUG: Changes made to monster behaviour do not affect saved games (i.e. spell cast)... probalby need to reload certain stats
- BUG: Widgets need to be displayed on the minimap
- BUG: Widgets will load all their settings from the save, but certain ones should come from XML (like animation speed)... likely applies to everything
- Setting for random character creation?
- Quick save feature -- WHAT KEY?
- Fail gracefully for incompatible browsers
- Option to launch new game
- Touch events?
- Add more text options so the log doesn't look so boring
- dynamic sizing of viewport based on window size... needs to have min/max dimensions set
- Belts should have utility slots
- Items in the inventory need detailed tooltips
- Gold
- Drag items onto body picture in Inventory to auto-equip
- Tooltips need to be split into two sections (one for detection and one for seeing/map showing)... split off num_items?
- Elite monsters (fancy names)
- Spawn more monsters at certain intervals
- Spawn items inside rooms and when monsters die
- Item stats, etc
- Double click to auto-equip item if slot is empty
- Status effects
  - Tooltip over status effects to show remaining duration
  - Persistent buff/debuff
    - no set duration, requires some kind of event to activate/deactivate
    - i.e. levitate or curse
